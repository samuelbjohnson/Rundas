<title>About Rundas</title>

<body>
<p>
	Rundas is the Hittite God of the Hunt and Good Fortune. Consequently, it seemed like an appropriate
	name for an application designed to facilitate the hunt (in the modern sense) and make it easier
	for users to be fortuitous (though by modern means) in their own fantasy sports-based pursuits.
